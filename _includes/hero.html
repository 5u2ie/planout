      <h3>Focus on parameters</h3>
      <p>
      PlanOut provides randomized parameter values to Internet
      services. Instead of using constants for user interface
      elements or switches controlling the rollout of a new feature or
      ranking model, just use PlanOut to determine the value of these
      parameters. Now you have an experiment.

      <h3>Simple or complex</h3>
      <p>
      It is easy to implement simple A/B tests in PlanOut.
      But it's also not much harder to implement factorial
      or within-subjects designs, or more complex designs involving multiple types of units
      (e.g., users and content),
      and conditional logic. Easily run experiments that help
      you understand your product and answer important questions.

      <h3>Extensible</h3>
      <p>
      PlanOut was developed at Facebook for running experiments involving hundreds
      of millions of people. It has been written with portability and extensibility in mind,
      and has been ported to all major Web programming languages, including Python, Java, PHP, JavaScript, Ruby, and Go.
