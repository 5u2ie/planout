## Editing the github.io site

The left-hand column index can be modified by editing `_data/nav_docs.yml`. These items point to files in the docs/ directory.

To edit and test your changes, type:
```
jekyll -w serve
```

Then, as you edit the files, the site will be available at `http://0.0.0.0:4000/planout/`.

Note, this might require installing the jekyll Ruby gem.
