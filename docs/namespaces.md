# Namespaces

Experiments often involve manipulating persistent parameters,
such that multiple experiments, whether conducted serially or in parallel,
manipulate the same parameters.

You can use a namespace model of parameters to support these practices.
Each namespace is centered around a primary unit (e.g., user) such that each primary unit
is only in one experiment that manipulates parameters in that namespace at once.
