This page explains the anatomy of the operator class and shows you how to
create new operators.

### PlanOutOp
All PlanOut operators inherit from the base class `PlanOutOp` located in
`ops/base.py`

All operators have an instance variable, `self.args`, which is populated with
the keyword arguments of the operator object when it is first initialized.
Children of the `PlanOutOp` base class implement the `execute()` method, which
do computations with this input data and return an output value (typically a
scalar but sometimes an array).

All operators, and therefore `self.arg` dictionaries are required to have an
`op` key which gives the name of the operator. This name is the same as the
operator name to class dispatch, located in `utils.ops.Operators.initFactory()`.
This method contains a dictionary mapping operator names (as read by the PlanOut
  interpreter) to classes.


Operators may also specify required and optional parameters, and implement a
pretty() method which prints JSON-encoded interpreter code as PlanOut language
code. Let's consider one such operator, `get`, which retrieves the value of
a given given variable `var` from the PlanOut execution environment.

```python
class Get(PlanOutOp):
  def options(self):
    return {'var': {'required': 1, 'description': 'variable to get'}}

  def execute(self, mapper):
    return mapper.get(self.args['var'])

  def pretty(self):
    return self.args['var']
```

Here, we can see that the operator has one required argument: `var`. Execution
occurs by implementing

Operator classes will sometimes implement a pretty() method. By default,
operators are output in terms of their
Most classes will in general, however
