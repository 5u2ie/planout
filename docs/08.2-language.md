The PlanOut language is a way to concisely define and serialize experiments.
The language provides basic logical operators, conditional execution,
and arrays, but does not include things like loops and function definitions.
This makes it easy to statically analyze experiments, and prevents users from
shooting themselves in the foot. The syntax mostly resembles JavaScript, except
comments are denoted by a `#`.


## Overview
 * Lines are terminated with a `;`
 * Arrays are defined like `[1,2,3]`, and are indexed starting at `0`.
 * Random assignment operators (e.g., `uniformChoice`, `weightedChoice`, `bernoulliTrial`) require named parameters, and begin with lowercase letters.
 * `#`s are used to write comments

## Compiling PlanOut code
There are a few ways to compile PlanOut code
* [Web-based compiler interface](http://facebook.github.io/planout/demo/planout-compiler.html)
* The node.js compiler script in the [`compiler/`](https://github.com/facebook/planout/tree/master/compiler) directory in the Github repository:
* The PlanOut editor

## Built-in operators

### Random assignment operators
All of PlanOut's [random assignment operators](random-operators.html) are available in
the PlanOut language. The variable name given on the left
hand side of an assignment operation is used as the salt, if no salt is
specified manually, e.g.,

```
colors = ['#aa2200', '#22aa00', '#0022aa'];
x = uniformChoice(choices=colors, unit=userid); # 'x' used as salt
y = uniformChoice(choices=colors, unit=userid); # 'y' used as salt, generally != x
z = uniformChoice(choices=colors, unit=userid, salt='x'); # same value as x
```


### Arrays and dictionaries operators
Arrays can include constants and variables, and can be arbitrarily nested, and can contain arbitrary types.

```
a = [4, 5, 'foo'];
b = [a, 2, 3];      # evaluates to [[1,2,'foo'], 2,3]
x = a[0];           # evaluates to 4
y = b[0][2];        # evaluates to 'foo'
l = length(b);      # evaluates to 3
```

PlanOut also has limited support for dictionaries, which may be passed in as inputs
into PlanOut or expressed in terms of constant (literals), denoted by `@`:

```
a = @{'foo':1, 'bar': [2,3]};
x = a['bar'][0];               # evaluates to 2
y = a['bogus']                 # evaluates to null
```

Note that the following code is not supported:

```
v = 1;
a = @{'foo': v};
b = {'foo': v};
```

When invalid indexes are accessed, PlanOut returns `null`, much like JavaScript:
b = [1,2,3];
n = b[5];                     # evaluates to null
m = b[5][1];                  # evaluates to null
c = coalesce(b[5], -1);       # evaluates to -1
c2 = coalesce(b[5][2], -1);   # evaluates to -1

#### Logical operators
Logical operators include *and* (`&&`), *or* (`||`), *not* (`!`), as in:

```
  a = 1; b = 0; c = 1;
  x = a && b;       # evaluates to False
  y = a || b || c;  # evaluates to True
  y = !b;           # evaluates to True
```

#### Control flow
Conditional execution can be implemented via if / else if / else.

```
if (country == 'US') {
  p = 0.2;
} else if (country == 'UK') {
  p = 0.4;
} else {
  p = 0.1;
}
```

#### Arithmetic
PlanOut supports basic arithmetic operations.

```
 a = 2 + 3 + 4;  # 9
 b = 2 * 3 * 4;  # 24
 c = -2;         # -2
 d = 2 + 3 - 4;  # 1
 e = 4 % 2;      # 0
 f = 4 / 2;      # 2.0
```

#### Other operators
Other operators that are part of the core language include `min` and `max`:

```
x = min(1, 2, -4);         # -4
y = min([1, 2, -4])        # -4
y = max(1, 2, -4)          # 2
r = round(5.4)             # 5
```
