Serialized PlanOut script definitions are easy to store in a database
or datastore. This aspect is key to scaling up an organization's
experimentation infrastructure.

Information about experiments, such as their expected inputs and the
variables they output can be directly parsed from serialized code. This allows
for: 

 -  Management interfaces can directly parse PlanOut code to show which columns
  should be exported to data storage systems, like [Presto](http://prestodb.io)
  and [Hive](https://hive.apache.org).

 - Analysis tools can also identify input
  variables from PlanOut scripts before they are run, to, e.g., specify which
  units to bootstrap on. This can be particularly important for ranking
  experiments, where both users and items need to be taken into account for
  when [computing confidence intervals](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.7406v3.pdf).

 Serialized PlanOut code is also easy to parse and generate, so it is possible to
 build graphical interfaces to construct simple experimental designs.
