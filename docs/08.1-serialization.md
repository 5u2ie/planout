 Serialized PlanOut code is easy to parse and generate, so it is possible to
 build graphical interfaces to construct simple experimental designs.

 Information about experiments, such as their expected inputs and the
  variables they output can be directly parsed from serialized code.

Serialization also helps fits in with logging and analysis infrastructure:

 -  Management interfaces can directly parse PlanOut code to show which columns
  should be exported to data storage systems, like [Presto](http://prestodb.io)
  and [Hive](https://hive.apache.org).

 - Analysis tools can also identify input
  variables from PlanOut scripts before they are run, to, e.g., specify which
  units to bootstrap on. This can be particularly important for ranking
  experiments, where both users and items need to be taken into account for
  when [computing confidence intervals](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.7406v3.pdf).
