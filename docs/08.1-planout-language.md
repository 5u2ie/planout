PlanOut experiments can be implemented in pure Python, but they may also be specified via a platform-independent serialization, which can be generated via the PlanOut compiler or through some user interface. Since interpreters can be written in any language, it is possible for serialized PlanOut code to executed on multiple kinds of devices and server platforms.

## The PlanOut Language as a way of serializing experiments
PlanOut language code gets compiled into a serialized JSON representation
which can be stored and retrieved at runtime.
This aspect is key to scaling up an organization's experimentation infrastructure.

For example, the PlanOut script:

```
button_color = uniformChoice(choices=["#ff0000", "#00ff00"], unit=userid);
button_text = uniformChoice(choices=["I'm voting", "I'm a voter"], unit=userid);
```

is [compiled](http://facebook.github.io/planout/demo/planout-compiler.html)
into JSON code (more on this in the [getting started page](getting-started-with-planout)):


## Who is the PlanOut language for?

The PlanOut language is suitable for

 - Scientists who want a simple language to express their experimental designs,
 and communicate these designs with non-programmers

 - Web developers who want want the ability to store scripts in a database,
   and would like to run follow-on experiments

 - Engineers who want to develop graphical interfaces to automatically generate
  PlanOut scripts

## What are some other advances and disadvantages?

#### Pros
 - Use of the [limited vocabulary](planout-language.html) means that your experiments are kept simple.
  Because PlanOut is not Turing complete, and each argument takes some optional
  and required parameters specified a priori, it's easy to check that your
  program will run, and not get caught in any loops.

 - Experiment definitions are [serialized](serialization.html),
  so they can easily be stored in databases, sent across networks, and executed
  on multiple platforms, including
  interpreters written in different languages. In fact, the same code that
  executes in the open-source Python version of PlanOut produces the same
  assignments as the PHP version of PlanOut used internally at Facebook.

 - PlanOut language scripts can be analyzed and tested automatically through
  the use of tools, like the PlanOut Editor.


#### Cons
 - You must use the PlanOut compiler, and/or develop graphical tools to generate
  serialized PlanOut code.

 - Use of the interpreter makes the most sense when you have a database set up
 to store experiment definitions.
