PlanOut experiments can be implemented in pure Python, but they may also be specified via a platform-independent serialization, which can be generated by the PlanOut compiler or through the use of custom interfaces. Since interpreters can be written in any language, it is possible for serialized PlanOut code to executed on multiple kinds of server platforms and devices.

## The PlanOut Language as a way of serializing experiments
PlanOut language code gets compiled into a serialized JSON representation
which can be stored and retrieved at runtime.
This aspect is key to scaling up an organization's experimentation infrastructure.

For example, the PlanOut script:

```
button_color = uniformChoice(choices=["#ff0000", "#00ff00"], unit=userid);
button_text = uniformChoice(choices=["I'm voting", "I'm a voter"], unit=userid);
```

is [compiled](http://facebook.github.io/planout/demo/planout-compiler.html)
into JSON code (more on this in the [getting started page](getting-started-with-planout)):


## Who is the PlanOut language for?

The PlanOut language is suitable for:

 - Scientists who want a parsimonious language for thinking about and communicating experimental desings.

 - Web developers who want to scale up their experimentation system, including
 having the ability to centrally manage and store experiment definitions in a database,
 develop graphical interfaces for setting up experiments, and easily
 manage simultaneous, non-overlapping experiments or follow-on experiments.
